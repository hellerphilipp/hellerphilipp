# Hi, I'm Philipp ðŸ‘‹

I got my Bachelor's in Product Management from [@codeuniversity](https://github.com/codeuniversity) in 2020, and currently work as a technology consultant. Before that, I collected multiple years of experience in tech-focused start-up and corporate environments. Throughout the years, I contributed to 12+ cross-functional project teams as product manager and software engineer, three of which I managed.

I started to write code at age 11, now I love to identify customersâ€™ pain points and build products that solve real-world problems. To deliver successful solutions efficiently, I focus on the most important metrics and quickly adapt to new insights.  

I am a constant learner who likes to spend his free time reading books or working on personal projects that help me learn new skills and gain new insights into the systems that power the modern world. I believe in the importance of a free world that's built on individual liberty and western values and hope to be able to work for that vision someday. Please feel free to contact me directly if you want to talk about innovative technology, economics, space flight, politics, or anything else of interest.
